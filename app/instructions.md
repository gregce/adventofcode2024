I want to build a flask app in python that will:

- Follow the format of @day_1/ 
- It should have an ability to take input instructions and a file to process if necessary
- It should then generate, with an LLM a spec based on the instructions
- It should be able to run the spec via an LLM to generate a solution and then run the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves scanning through a corrupted string of memory to identify and process valid `mul(X,Y)` instructions, where `X` and `Y` are integers. The goal is to sum the results of these multiplications. The instructions can be enabled or disabled by preceding `do()` or `don't()` instructions, respectively. Initially, `mul` instructions are enabled.

### Input Processing

The input is a single, long string of corrupted memory containing valid and invalid characters, numbers, and instructions. The valid instructions to look for are:

- `mul(X,Y)`: Multiply `X` by `Y`. Only consider this instruction if multiplication is currently enabled.
- `do()`: Enable future `mul` instructions.
- `don't()`: Disable future `mul` instructions.

Invalid characters and sequences should be ignored.

#### Steps to Process Input:

1. **Read the Input**: Capture the entire corrupted memory string as input.
2. **Identify Instructions**: Use regular expressions or string parsing techniques to find all occurrences of `mul(X,Y)`, `do()`, and `don't()` in the input string.
   - A regex pattern like `(mul\(\d+,\d+\)|do\(\)|don't\(\))` can be used to find matches.
3. **Extract Numbers for Multiplication**: For each `mul(X,Y)` match, extract `X` and `Y` as integers.

### Solution Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - Create a variable to keep track of the sum of multiplications (`totalSum`).
   - Use a boolean flag (`isMulEnabled`) to track whether `mul` instructions should be processed (initialized to `true`).

2. **Process Each Instruction**:
   - Loop through each instruction found during input processing.
   - If the instruction is `do()`, set `isMulEnabled` to `true`.
   - If the instruction is `don't()`, set `isMulEnabled` to `false`.
   - If the instruction is `mul(X,Y)`, and `isMulEnabled` is `true`, multiply `X` and `Y`, and add the result to `totalSum`.

3. **Continue Until All Instructions Are Processed**: Iterate through the entire string, applying the above logic to each instruction.

4. **Return the `totalSum`** as the final result.

### Expected Output

The solution should return a single integer: the sum of all enabled `mul(X,Y)` results found in the corrupted memory string.

### Edge Cases

1. **Adjacent Instructions**: Ensure that the `do()` and `don't()` instructions correctly enable or disable subsequent `mul` instructions, regardless of how closely they are placed to each other.
2. **Invalid Formats**: Instructions surrounded by invalid characters or with space anomalies should be ignored (e.g., `mul (2, 3)` is considered invalid due to the space after `mul`).
3. **Large Numbers**: The solution should correctly handle the case where `X` or `Y` in a `mul` instruction are large (up to 3 digits as mentioned).
4. **No Valid Instructions**: If there are no valid `mul` instructions or all are disabled, the result should be `0`.
5. **Performance**: The algorithm should efficiently handle long strings of memory without significant performance degradation.

### Detailed Specification for Calculating the Similarity Score Between Two Lists

#### 1. Problem Analysis

The task is to calculate a similarity score between two lists of location IDs. For each number in the left list, its contribution to the similarity score is the product of the number itself and the frequency of that number in the right list. The total similarity score is the sum of these individual contributions.

#### 2. Input Processing

- The input consists of pairs of integers, each pair on a new line, separated by spaces or tabs.
- The first integer of each pair belongs to the left list, and the second to the right list.

Steps to process the input:

1. Read the input line by line.
2. Split each line by whitespace to separate the two numbers.
3. Convert each number from string to integer.
4. Store the first number of each pair in a list representing the left list, and the second number in another list for the right list.

#### 3. Solution Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies in the Right List:** Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the right list. The key will be the number itself, and the value will be the count of how many times it appears.

2. **Calculate Similarity Score:**
   - Initialize a variable to hold the total similarity score, starting at 0.
   - Iterate through each number in the left list.
   - For each number, check if it exists in the dictionary (right list frequencies).
   - If it exists, multiply the number by its frequency (the value from the dictionary) and add the result to the total similarity score.
   - If it does not exist in the dictionary, move to the next number without modifying the score.

3. **Return the Total Similarity Score.**

#### 4. Expected Output

- The solution should output a single integer: the total similarity score based on the described calculation method.

#### 5. Edge Cases

- **Empty Lists:** If one or both of the lists are empty, the similarity score should be 0.
- **Non-Integer Inputs:** While the problem description implies the use of integers, it's important to ensure that the input processing step correctly handles and converts the input data to integers.
- **Duplicates in Lists:** The left list can contain duplicates. Each occurrence should be treated individually during the similarity score calculation.
- **Large Numbers:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle large numbers in the input, as well as a large number of entries.

### Implementation Notes

- It's important to consider the efficiency of the solution, especially the frequency counting in the right list, which can be optimally implemented using a dictionary (or a `defaultdict` from Python's `collections` module for more concise code).
- For languages without built-in dictionary types (e.g., C++), a `map` or a `hashmap` can be used to achieve similar functionality.
- Be mindful of memory usage if the input lists are significantly large. Efficient storage and iteration techniques might be necessary.
